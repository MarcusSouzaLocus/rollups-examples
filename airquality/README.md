This example shows a simple way of leveraging some of the most widely used Machine Learning libraries available in Python.

The DApp generates a [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) model using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and then uses [m2cgen (Model to Code Generator)](https://github.com/BayesWitnesses/m2cgen) to transpile that model into native Python code with no dependencies.
This approach is inspired by [Davis David's Machine Learning tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/transform-machine-learning-models-into-native-code-with-zero-dependencies/), and is useful for a Cartesi DApp because it removes the need of porting all those Machine Learning libraries to the Cartesi Machine's RISC-V architecture, making the development process easier and the final back-end code simpler to execute.

The practical goal of this application is to predict a classification based on the [Air Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/air-quality-data-set/), which contains the responses of a gas multisensor device deployed on the field in an Italian city. Hourly responses averages are recorded along with gas concentrations references from a certified analyzer.

The model currently takes into account several variables for predicting the AQI(Air quality index):

1. PT08.S1(CO): This represents the sensor response to Carbon Monoxide (CO) levels in the air.

2. PT08.S2(NMHC): This represents the sensor response to Non-Methane Hydrocarbons (NMHC) in the air. For instance, the value 1046 is the sensor reading, which can be correlated to the actual concentration of NMHC in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).

3. PT08.S3(NOx): This represents the sensor response to Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) in the air. For instance, the value 1056 is the sensor reading, which can be correlated to the actual concentration of NOx in parts per billion (ppb).

4. PT08.S4(NO2): This represents the sensor response to Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in the air. For instance , the value 1692 is the sensor reading, which can be correlated to the actual concentration of NO2 in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).

5. PT08.S5(O3): This represents the sensor response to Ozone (O3) in the air. For instance, the value 1268 is the sensor reading, which can be correlated to the actual concentration of O3 in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).

6. T: This represents the temperature in degrees Celsius. For instance, the value 21.6 is the measured temperature.

7. RH: This represents the Relative Humidity in percentage. For instance, the value 13.6 is the measured relative humidity.

8. AH: This represents the Absolute Humidity, which is the total water content in the air. For instance, the value 0.76 could be the absolute humidity in grams per cubic meter (g/m³).

As such, inputs to the DApp should be given as a JSON string such as the following:

```json
{"PT08.S1(CO)": 1360, "PT08.S2(NMHC)": 1046, "PT08.S3(NOx)": 1056, "PT08.S4(NO2)": 1692, "PT08.S5(O3)": 1268, "T": 21.6, "RH": 13.6, "AH": 0.76}
```

## Interacting with the application

We can use the [frontend-console](../frontend-console) application to interact with the DApp.
Ensure that the [application has already been built](../frontend-console/README.md#building) before using it.

First, go to a separate terminal window and switch to the `frontend-console` directory:

```shell
cd frontend-console
```

Then, send an input as follows:

```shell
yarn start input send --payload '{"PT08.S1(CO)": 1360, "PT08.S2(NMHC)": 1046, "PT08.S3(NOx)": 1056, "PT08.S4(NO2)": 1692, "PT08.S5(O3)": 1268, "T": 21.6, "RH": 13.6, "AH": 0.76}'
```

In order to verify the notices generated by your inputs, run the command:

```shell
yarn start notice list
```

The payload of the notice corresponds one of the list of the standard range for AQI: (`"Good"`),(`"Moderate"`),(`"Bad for sensible groups"`),(`"Bad"`),(`"Very Bad"`) and (`"Dangerous"`).
In this case, it should be `"Moderate"`.

## Running the environment in host mode

When developing an application, it is often important to easily test and debug it. For that matter, it is possible to run the Cartesi Rollups environment in [host mode](../README.md#host-mode), so that the DApp's back-end can be executed directly on the host machine, allowing it to be debugged using regular development tools such as an IDE.

In order to start the back-end, run the following commands in a dedicated terminal:

```shell
cd airquality
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
ROLLUP_HTTP_SERVER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5004" python3 airquality.py
```

The final command will effectively run the back-end and send corresponding outputs to port `5004`.
It can optionally be configured in an IDE to allow interactive debugging using features like breakpoints.

You can also use a tool like [entr](https://eradman.com/entrproject/) to restart the back-end automatically when the code changes. For example:

```shell
ls *.py | ROLLUP_HTTP_SERVER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5004" entr -r python3 airquality.py
```

After the back-end successfully starts, it should print an output like the following:

```log
INFO:__main__:HTTP rollup_server url is http://127.0.0.1:5004
INFO:__main__:Sending finish
```

After that, you can interact with the application normally [as explained above](#interacting-with-the-application).

## Changing the application

This DApp was implemented in a rather generic way and, as such, it is possible to easily change the target dataset as well as the predictor algorithm.

To change those, open the file `airquality/model/build_model.py` and change the following variables defined at the beginning of the script:

- `model`: defines the scikit-learn predictor algorithm to use. While it currently uses `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`, many [other possibilities](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) are available, from several types of linear regressions to solutions such as support vector machines (SVMs).
- `train_csv`: a URL or file path to a CSV file containing the dataset. It should contain a first row with the feature names, followed by the data.
